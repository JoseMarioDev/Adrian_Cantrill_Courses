üîë Encryption 101 - part 1

encryption approaches

- encryption at rest - data stored in hardware in encrypted form
- encryption in transit - apply encryption wrapper while data is being transferred

concepts

- Plaintext - unencrypted data
- Algorithm - code takes plaintext and key and encrypts data
- key - password
- Ciphertext - result of data that is encrypted with algorithm and key

symmetric encryption

- same key is used for encryption and decryption process
- good for local encryption like data on a laptop
- not so good when data needs to be sent over network between parties

asymmetric encryption

- uses 2 keys - public key and private key
- no requirement to exchange keys in advance
- used when 2 or more parties are involved and havent met before
- used by SSL, TLS, PGP, SSH
- much more difficult to do vs symmetric

---

üîë Encryption 101 - part 2

signing

- when receiver acknowledges to sender message received
- receiver sends message encrypted w/private key to sender
- sender uses public key to decrypt message and verify if private key is correct
- inverse of asymmetric encryption process
- used for ID verification and login systems

steganography

- process of hiding something in something else
- think of "using invisible ink" in spy tactics
- embed data in other data

üåé Network Starter Pack - OSI Model

OSI Model

higher layers build on lower layers

üåé Network Starter Pack Layer 1 - Physical

- physical medium can be copper, fiber, or wifi
- used to connect computers together
- hardware: hub - repeats to all devices on network, including collisions
- no access control
- no unique identified devices

---

üåé Network Starter Pack Layer 2 - Data Link

- uses Frames - format for sending data over network
- hardware: switch
  - store and forward frames
  - keeps mac address table. learns which devices are connected
  - doesn't forward collisions
- mac addresses - unique hardware address for each NIC
- frame is a container w/components

  - preamble
  - destination/source mac addresses
  - ethertype - specify layer 3 protocol
  - payload - data frame is sending
  - frame check sequence

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be619681-5196-4342-8cf2-1988e2463636/Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_8.18.38_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be619681-5196-4342-8cf2-1988e2463636/Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_8.18.38_AM.png)

- CSMA/CD
  - carrier sense multiple access/collision detection
  - sender listens to see if traffic is on layer 1. if not, it sends frame to receiver
  - if it senses traffic, it's backs away for a random time and tries again
  - uses encapsulation(taking data wrapping it in something else), layer 3 loads payload inside frame to send

üåé Network Starter Pack Layer 3 - Network

Fundamentals

- adds ability for cross-network addressing(IP addresses)
- uses Packets to route across different layer 2 networks via Layer 2 encapsulation
- hardware: router
- forwards decisions using route and route tables
- every IPv4 packet has:
  - source/destination IP address
  - protocol field - Layer 4(TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Data - generated from Layer 4 protocol
  - TTL
- every IPv6 packet has:
  - source/dest IP address
  - data
  - hop limit - similar to TTL

IP addressing v4

- dotted decimal notation - ex: 133.33.3.7
- 2 parts
  - network part and host part
  - if network part of 2 ip addresses match, they are on the same network
  - if not, they are on diff networks
- assigned either statically or dynamically
- want them to be unique

Subnet Mask

- allow host to determine if IP addresses it needs to communicate with is local or remote
- determines if needs use gateway or can communicate locally

Route Tables & Routes

- every router as at least 1 table attached to a NIC
- table is a collection of routes with destination and next hop
- /32 means 1 specific IP addresses. /0 means all IPs

üåé Network Starter Pack Layers 4 and 5 - Transport and Session

Concepts

- Transport layer runs on top of network layer. Session runs on top of Transport
- limitations of layer 3
  - packets are routed independently, might arrive to receiver out or order
  - provides no method of assuring method arrival
  - packets can go missing
  - no method of splitting by app or channel
  - ip has no flow control. if sender is sending packets too fast for receiver

TCP/UDP

- TCP
  - reliable
  - error correction
  - ordering of data
  - HTTP/HTTPS/SSH
  - establishes handshake
- UDP
  - less reliable
  - faster
  - doesnt error correct nor handshake
- TCP Segments
  - encapsulated in IP packets
  - dont have src or dst IPs. provided by packets
  - Do have src/dst ports
  - has sequence number to correctly order segments at receiver
  - acknowledgement field
  - flags
  - window - flow control, indicates how much can receive
  - checksum
  - urgent pointer
  - data

TCP Architecture

- how connections works
- creates 2 streams using well known ports and ephemeral ports

- SYN sends sequence number
- SYN-ACK sequence num + Acknowledge
- ACK sender acknowledges receipt of acknowledgement

üåé Network Starter Pack - Subnetting

Concepts

- IP classes were broken into classes - A, B, C

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/302ce9f9-5e69-49f5-866e-6f4617635e33/Screen_Shot_2021-05-15_at_9.22.48_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/302ce9f9-5e69-49f5-866e-6f4617635e33/Screen_Shot_2021-05-15_at_9.22.48_AM.png)

Private Range of IPs

- were setup to be used for internal networks. not public for internet. 1 range for each class - A, B, C
- use NAT to access internet because IP addresses were running out
- IPv6 was created to solve problem, so many addresses available it won't run out

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/06c8528a-0372-4257-bc21-87235b42e171/Screen_Shot_2021-05-15_at_9.25.18_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/06c8528a-0372-4257-bc21-87235b42e171/Screen_Shot_2021-05-15_at_9.25.18_AM.png)

Subnetting

- process of breaking down IP range into pieces
- done by diving larger network/2, then breaking down those parts further if need be
- CIDR uses /num

üõ£Ô∏è. SSL and TLS

Concepts

- TLS is newer, more secure version os SSL
- provides privacy and data integrity between client/server
- makes sure communications are encrypted
- uses asymmetric at first, then moves to symmetric for ongoing(easier to perform)
- identity verification - server or client/server verified
- reliable connection - protect again alteration of data in transit

Three phases to secure communication

- operates at Layer 4
  1. Cipher Suites - set of protocols used by TLS
     - algorithms grouped together
     - client/server must agree on what cipher suite to use
  2. Authentication
     - client verifies server id by verifying it's SSL cert with PCA
     - PCA = public certificate authority
     - client encrypts data and sends to server to verify server has private key
  3. Key exchange
     - move to symmetric encryption
     - generates premaster key and it's used to create a master secret which is used going forward
