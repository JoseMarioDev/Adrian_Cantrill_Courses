## üóíÔ∏è  Notes

üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª  YAML 101

- collection of key/value pairs
- supports strings, floats, ints, bool, lists, dict
- supports lists
    - lists can be inline
    - or indented with dashes "-"

- values can be in parentheses or not, both are valid
- supports dictionaries - a list of dictionaries
- is used for [CloudFormation](https://www.notion.so/CloudFormation-b92ad6a9f91d4cbf9d879fea5f1fb61d)
- indentation matters

üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª  JSON 101

- key/value pairs
- similar to YAML but format is just different
- doesn't care about indentation
- values can be string, obj, num, array, bool, or null
- supports objects and arrays.  can be nested
- used for AWS policies

üîë  Encryption 101 - part 1

encryption approaches

- encryption at rest -  data stored in hardware in encrypted form
- encryption in transit - apply encryption wrapper while data is being transferred

concepts

- Plaintext - unencrypted data
- Algorithm - code takes plaintext and key and encrypts data
- key - password
- Ciphertext - result of data that is encrypted with algorithm and key

symmetric encryption

- same key is used for encryption and decryption process
- good for local encryption like data on a laptop
- not so good when data needs to be sent over network between parties

asymmetric encryption

- uses 2 keys - public key and private key
- no requirement to exchange keys in advance
- used when 2 or more parties are involved and havent met before
- used by SSL, TLS, PGP, SSH
- much more difficult to do vs symmetric

---

üîë  Encryption 101 - part 2

signing

- when receiver acknowledges to sender message received
- receiver sends message encrypted w/private key to sender
- sender uses public key to decrypt message and verify if private key is correct
- inverse of asymmetric encryption process
- used for ID verification and login systems

steganography

- process of hiding something in something else
- think of "using invisible ink" in spy tactics
- embed data in other data

üåé  Network Starter Pack  - OSI Model 

OSI Model

higher layers build on lower layers

üåé  Network Starter Pack Layer 1 - Physical 

- physical medium can be copper, fiber, or wifi
- used to connect computers together
- hardware: hub - repeats to all devices on network, including collisions
- no access control
- no unique identified devices

---

üåé  Network Starter Pack Layer 2 - Data Link

- uses Frames - format for sending data over network
- hardware: switch
    - store and forward frames
    - keeps mac address table.  learns which devices are connected
    - doesn't forward collisions
- mac addresses - unique hardware address for each NIC
- frame is a container w/components
    - preamble
    - destination/source mac addresses
    - ethertype - specify layer 3 protocol
    - payload - data frame is sending
    - frame check sequence

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be619681-5196-4342-8cf2-1988e2463636/Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_8.18.38_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be619681-5196-4342-8cf2-1988e2463636/Screen_Shot_2021-05-13_at_8.18.38_AM.png)

- CSMA/CD
    - carrier sense multiple access/collision detection
    - sender listens to see if traffic is on layer 1. if not, it sends frame to receiver
    - if it senses traffic, it's backs away for a random time and tries again
    - uses encapsulation(taking data wrapping it in something else), layer 3 loads payload inside frame to send

üî¢  Decimal to Binary Conversion - IP Addressing

- focuses on IPv4
- 32 bits, 4 x 8bits
- 8 bits in a byte

üåé  Network Starter Pack Layer 3 - Network 

Fundamentals

- adds ability for cross-network addressing(IP addresses)
- uses Packets to route across different layer 2 networks via Layer 2 encapsulation
- hardware: router
- forwards decisions using route and route tables
- every IPv4 packet has:
    - source/destination IP address
    - protocol field - Layer 4(TCP, UDP, ICMP)
    - Data - generated from Layer 4 protocol
    - TTL
- every IPv6 packet has:
    - source/dest IP address
    - data
    - hop limit - similar to TTL

IP addressing v4

- dotted decimal notation  - ex: 133.33.3.7
- 2 parts
    - network part and host part
    - if network part of 2 ip addresses match, they are on the same network
    - if not, they are on diff networks
- assigned either statically or dynamically
- want them to be unique

Subnet Mask

- allow host to determine if IP addresses it needs to communicate with is local or remote
- determines if needs use gateway or can communicate locally

Route Tables & Routes

- every router as at least 1 table attached to a NIC
- table is a collection of routes with destination and next hop
- /32 means 1 specific IP addresses. /0 means all IPs

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol

- used for layer 3 packet to encapsulate inside a frame
- find mac address for an ip address

Summary

- Layer 3 adds IP addresses, ARP, Routes, Route Tables, Routers
- device to device communication over internet
- no method for channels of communication - Layer 4
- can be delivered out of order

üåé  Network Starter Pack Layers 4 and 5 - Transport and Session 

Concepts

- Transport layer runs on top of network layer.  Session runs on top of Transport
- limitations of layer 3
    - packets are routed independently, might arrive to receiver out or order
    - provides no method of assuring method arrival
    - packets can go missing
    - no method of splitting by app or channel
    - ip has no flow control.  if sender is sending packets too fast for receiver

TCP/UDP

- TCP
    - reliable
    - error correction
    - ordering of data
    - HTTP/HTTPS/SSH
    - establishes handshake
- UDP
    - less reliable
    - faster
    - doesnt error correct nor handshake
- TCP Segments
    - encapsulated in IP packets
    - dont have src or dst IPs.  provided by packets
    - Do have src/dst ports
    - has sequence number to correctly order segments at receiver
    - acknowledgement field
    - flags
    - window - flow control, indicates how much can receive
    - checksum
    - urgent pointer
    - data

TCP Architecture

- how connections works
- creates 2 streams using well known ports and ephemeral ports

- 3 way handshake flags
- SYN sends sequence number
- SYN-ACK sequence num + Acknowledge
- ACK  sender acknowledges receipt of acknowledgement

Sessions & State

- stateless firewalls see two things
- two rules will be required out and in - AWS NaCL
- Stateful firewalls sees one things automatically allows out and in - AWS Security Groups
