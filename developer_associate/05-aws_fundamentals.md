## üóíÔ∏è Notes

### üåê Public vs Private Services

Concepts

- services can be categorized into 2 categories: Public and Private
- applies to networking - no permissions by default. difference is connectivity
- examples of an AWS public service:

Private Zone

- no connections are allowed to private zone by anywhere else by default
- examples:

  [VPC](https://www.notion.so/VPC-b9469cde682c4a66b4bf25169fae705c)

  [EC2](https://www.notion.so/EC2-33b59c5db2b340c2b767143caaf427d7)

- can config private services so they have public access
- what you're doing is taking a private service(ex: EC2) and putting it in a public zone

### üåê AWS Global Infrastructure

Concepts

- [https://www.infrastructure.aws/](https://www.infrastructure.aws/)
- regions
  - AWS major locations across the globe
  - separate geographically - isolated fault domain
  - location control
  - geopolitical separation
- edge locations
  - smaller than regions, but spread out across the country more
  - low latency, high speed distribution
  - CDNs
- availability zones
  - zones inside regions
  - regions have multiple AZs
  - isolated infrastructure inside a region

Resilient Levels

- Globally resilient

  - few of these inside AWS
  - service is global, no concept of picking a region.

  [Route 53](https://www.notion.so/Route-53-862cb3558c3144c09c3766ea05a0a169)

- Regionally resilient
  - operate in separate services in each region
    - ex: US-east-1, ohio, asia, eu, etc
    - can replicate data to multiple AZs in that region
- AZ resilient
  - services that run in a single AZ
  - if the AZ service is running in fails, the service fails
  - are prone to failure

### üßîüèΩüñ•Ô∏è Shared Responsibility Model

Concepts

- provides clarity around which areas of system security are AWS and which are owned by customer

### üåê High-Availability vs Fault Tolerance vs Disaster Recovery

Concepts

High Availability

- aims to ensure an agreed level of uptime, for a higher than normal period
- doesn't aim to stop failure
- components can be replaced as quick as possible
- maximizing online time
- user disruption, while not ideal, is ok
- expressed in a percentage of uptime
- 99.999% (five nines) availability is 5.26 minutes of downtime/year

Fault Tolerance

- much more than HA
- FT means to operate through failure
- system continues to operate properly in event of failure of it's components
- can be expensive

Disaster Recovery

- polices, tools, procedures to enable recovery of infrastructure and systems following a disaster
- preplanning in advance
- taking backups offsite

Summary

- HA - minimize any outages
- FT - operate through faults
- DR-used when these don't work
