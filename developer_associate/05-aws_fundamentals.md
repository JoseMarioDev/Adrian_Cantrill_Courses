### üåê Public vs Private Services

Concepts

- services can be categorized into 2 categories: Public and Private
- applies to networking - no permissions by default. difference is connectivity
- examples of an AWS public service:

Private Zone

- no connections are allowed to private zone by anywhere else by default
- examples:

  [EC2](https://www.notion.so/EC2-33b59c5db2b340c2b767143caaf427d7)

- can config private services so they have public access
- what you're doing is taking a private service(ex: EC2) and putting it in a public zone

### üåê AWS Global Infrastructure

Concepts

- [https://www.infrastructure.aws/](https://www.infrastructure.aws/)
- regions
  - AWS major locations across the globe
  - separate geographically - isolated fault domain
  - location control
  - geopolitical separation
- edge locations
  - smaller than regions, but spread out across the country more
  - low latency, high speed distribution
  - CDNs
- availability zones
  - zones inside regions
  - regions have multiple AZs
  - isolated infrastructure inside a region

Resilient Levels

- Globally resilient

  - few of these inside AWS
  - service is global, no concept of picking a region.

  [Route 53](https://www.notion.so/Route-53-862cb3558c3144c09c3766ea05a0a169)

- Regionally resilient
  - operate in separate services in each region
    - ex: US-east-1, ohio, asia, eu, etc
    - can replicate data to multiple AZs in that region
- AZ resilient
  - services that run in a single AZ
  - if the AZ service is running in fails, the service fails
  - are prone to failure
