## üóíÔ∏è Notes

Concepts

- discovery service
- IP address to domain names
- uses zone files that holds the domain name and it's IP address
  - file is hosted on a name server

Terms

- _DNS Client_ - your laptop, phone, tablet, PC
- _Resolver_ - software on your device, or a server on the ISP that queries DNS on your behalf
- _Zone-_ part of the DNS database
- _Zonefile-_ physical database for a zone
- _Nameserver- server where zonefiles are hosted_

Structure

- DNS is distributed. data is stored in zonefiles that are stored on nameservers globally
- DNS Root is the starting point
- structured like an upside down tree

Root

- topmost part of DNS. known as DNS Root or Root Zone
- database is hosted on 13 special name servers
- known as root servers
- operated by 12 diff large companies
  - only manage root servers themselves, not the database

Process for finding root servers

- your laptop will query a resolver server
- the OS vendor of the server provides a root hints file
  - list or root servers
- the resolvers communicates with the root servers to find the IP address
- IANA manages the DNS root zone

- the resolver communicates with the root servers because there is a trust there
- important to know these servers communicate with each other because they are _authoritative_ or have trust
- IANA delegates the top level domains to other organizations, known as _registries_

DNS Resolution Visually

- information is distributed
- delegation and trust are used to move you one step closer to the address you need

Summary

- root hints ‚Üí config file points at the root servers IPs and addresses
- root servers ‚Üí host the DNS root zone
- root zone ‚Üí points at top level domains authoritative servers
- gTLD ‚Üí generic top level domains. ex: .com, .org
- ccTLD ‚Üí country-code top level domains. ex: .uk, .eu, .mx

Record Types

DNS is capable of handling a number of diff record types, which perform diff tasks

1. _A -_ maps hosts names to IPv4 addresses
2. _AAAA_ - maps hosts name to IPv6 addresses
3. _CNAME -_ Host to Host record

4. _TXT -_ add arbitrary text to a domain

   - can be used to prove ownership

5. _MX -_ email servers

   - how a server can find a mail server for a specific domain
   - have 2 main parts - value and priority

TTL

- can be set on DNS records
- set in seconds
- how long the query results are stored on the resolver
- authoritative results come from the nameserver
- non-authoritative results come from the resolver
