## üóíÔ∏è Notes

### üñ•Ô∏è Basics

Concepts

- provides access to VMs known as instances
- compute power
- IaaS. unit of consumption is the instance
- private AWS service. runs in single VPC subnet
- AZ resilient
- diff sizes and capabilities
- on demand billing - per second
- pay for what you consume

  - local onhost storage

  [EBS](https://www.notion.so/EBS-4b58a9b890694630a153928aaa013797)

States

- instances are composed of CPU, disk, memory, networking
- running
  - charged for all 4 categories
- stopped
  - **no CPU, memory, network charges**
  - still charged for storage
- terminated
  - no charge for all 4. all are deleted

AMI - Amazon Machine Image

- is image of EC2 instance
- use to create an instance or created from an instance
- similar to server image
- contains:
  - attached permissions
  - can be set as public
  - owner is implicitly allowed
  - can add explicit permissions to specific AWS accounts
- contains root volume
- contains block device mapping
  - mapping between volumes and how OS sees them

Connections

- connect to EC2 instance via:
  - remote desktop on Windows. port 3389
  - SSH on Linux. port 22
- use SSH key pair
  - public and private parts

üñ•Ô∏è. EBS Encryption(Theory & Demo)

Concepts

- by default no encryption is applied
- applies at rest encryption for volumes and snapshots
- uses KMS to create a CMK
  - can be AWS managed - default
  - or customer managed
- creates Data Encryption Key(DEK)
  - key is encrypted by KMS
  - when needed to encrypt data, EBS asks KMS to decrypt the key
  - then sends key to EC2 host, loaded in memory of EC2 host
  - instance can now use the key to encrypt/decrypt data
- if snapshot is created, it's also encrypted with the DEK

  - any volumes created from snapshot are as well

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4fa46101-9064-45e7-b17c-1ad42b41684e/Screen_Shot_2021-06-14_at_6.53.54_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4fa46101-9064-45e7-b17c-1ad42b41684e/Screen_Shot_2021-06-14_at_6.53.54_PM.png)

Exam Power Up

- accounts can config to set encryption by default - default is CMK
- otherwise choose a CMK to use
- each volume uses 1 unique DEK
- snapshots and future vols use the same DEK
- cant change a vol to not be encrypted once done
- OS isn't aware of the encryption. occurs between EBS and the host
  - uses AES-256

Demo Walk-thru

- go to EC2 services, launch an EC2 instance
- select encryption when choosing storage

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/45134368-128c-4238-a57d-f7f6ba7cabe3/Screen_Shot_2021-06-14_at_6.59.20_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/45134368-128c-4238-a57d-f7f6ba7cabe3/Screen_Shot_2021-06-14_at_6.59.20_PM.png)

- look at volumes from left sidebar
  - will tell you it's encrypted
  - if you create snapshot from vol, notice it's automatically encrypted as well
  - create volume from snapshot, notice it will be encrypted by default as well
  - cannot turn off
  - but can change the master key

üñ•Ô∏è. EC2 Purchase Options

Concepts

- there are a number of diff EC2 purchase options, with diff mechanics and use cases
- aka Launch Types

On-Demand

- default - average of everything
- per-second billing while instance is running
- associated resources such as storage are billed
- no interruption
- no capacity reservation
- predictable pricing
- no upfront costs
- no discount
- best for:

  - short term workloads
  - unknown workloads
  - apps which cant be interrupted
  -

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e9ea3195-1765-44f9-95b3-8fa4908b595b/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.45.08_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e9ea3195-1765-44f9-95b3-8fa4908b595b/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.45.08_PM.png)

Spot

- is AWS selling unused EC2 host capacity for up to 90% discount
- spot price is based on the spare capacity at any given time
- if spot price is higher than your max price, your instances are terminated
- never use for workloads that can't tolerate interruptions
- good for non time critical
- anything that can be rerun
- burst capacity needs
- cost sensitive workloads
- anything that is stateless

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/aaaf216b-2b66-41df-b295-8e675d0c88b5/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.51.01_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/aaaf216b-2b66-41df-b295-8e675d0c88b5/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.51.01_PM.png)

Reserved

- for long term instance usage
- reduce per-second cost or remove it entirely
- need to plan appropriately, you pay for any non-usage
- can commit for either 1 year or 3 years
- diff payment structures

  - no upfront - some savings for agreeing to the terms
  - pay all upfront - greater discount
  - partial upfront - middle ground

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fe5d8665-e847-43e7-a93b-ae967c69bd12/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.57.08_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fe5d8665-e847-43e7-a93b-ae967c69bd12/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.57.08_PM.png)

Dedicated Host

- Host that is allocated to you in it's entirety
- pay for host itself
- come with all resources you'd expect from a machine
- you pay for the host - no per-second charge
- you manage the capacity
- use for license based software
- use for host affinity

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f569f5ee-c615-4ee2-8092-9a25b70a775d/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.59.47_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f569f5ee-c615-4ee2-8092-9a25b70a775d/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_4.59.47_PM.png)

Dedicated Instance

- middle ground - instances run on EC2 hosts that you have for yourself
- pay hourly fee
- fee for instances

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7ed73b0a-1393-4e6f-a08a-59320938c93c/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.02.10_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7ed73b0a-1393-4e6f-a08a-59320938c93c/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.02.10_PM.png)

üñ•Ô∏è. Reserved Instances - the rest

Scheduled Reserved Instances

- ideal for long term usage which doesn't run constantly
- slightly cheaper, can only use during time window you specify

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a96dc296-05de-4124-9586-6262ed7aa9e9/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.06.25_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a96dc296-05de-4124-9586-6262ed7aa9e9/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.06.25_PM.png)

Capacity Reservations

- can reserve instances in a region
- can pick zonal reservation - in a specific AZ
- on demand capacity reservations - ensure you always have access to capacity in AZ

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2f4e6cfa-4c59-4b84-9b14-d38416531dc6/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.09.51_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2f4e6cfa-4c59-4b84-9b14-d38416531dc6/Screen_Shot_2021-06-17_at_5.09.51_PM.png)

EC2 Savings Plan

- hourly commitment for 1 or 3 year term
- can make a reservation of general compute $ amounts
- or a specific EC2 savings plan - flexible on size and OS

üñ•Ô∏è. EC2 Placement Groups

Concepts

- [link to AWS doc on EC2 placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)
- three diff types of placement groups available
  - cluster - performance
  - spread - resilience
  - partition - topology awareness

Cluster

- highest level of performance
- launch all instances in group at same time
- use same type of instance and launch them at same time
- launched in same AZ
- same rack and sometimes same host
- all members have direct connections to each other
- lowest latency possible and max packet-per-second possible
- can't span AZs. only one AZ locked when launching first instance
- can span VPC peers, but impacts performance
- requires supported instance type
- should use same type of instance
- should launch at same time - recommended
- offer 10Gbps single stream performance
- use cases: performance, fast speed, low latency

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f3e2e761-1033-458f-9eeb-ea08a49d8316/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.38.28_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f3e2e761-1033-458f-9eeb-ea08a49d8316/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.38.28_AM.png)

Spread

- can span multiple AZs
- instance on separate racks
- limit to 7 instances per AZ

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8f88bf44-f38a-4f94-8370-39fdbd14a2b2/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.41.41_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8f88bf44-f38a-4f94-8370-39fdbd14a2b2/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.41.41_AM.png)

- provides infrastructure isolation
- each instance run from diff rack
- each rack has it's own network and power source
- 7 instances per AZ - hard limit
- not supported for dedicated instances or dedicated hosts
- use case: small num of critical instances that need to be kept separate

Partition

- similar to spread
- when you need more than 7 instances per AZ but still need to spread out
- each AZ is separated in partitions
- each partition can have as many instances as you want
- each partition has it's own racks - no sharing between partitions
- designed for huge scale parallel processing systems

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5a1c0d21-7ee2-4704-b3ca-cf94a2d0a914/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.58.23_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5a1c0d21-7ee2-4704-b3ca-cf94a2d0a914/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_11.58.23_AM.png)

- 7 partitions per AZ
- instances can be placed in a specific partitions
  - or auto placed
- great for topology aware apps
  - HDFS, HBASE, Cassandra
- contain the impact of failure to part of an application

üñ•Ô∏è. Enhanced Networking & EBS Optimized

Concepts

- AWS implementation of SR-IOV, a standard allowing a physical host network card to present many logical devices which can be used directly by instances
- lower host CPU usage, better throughput, lower and consistent latency
- EBS optimization on instances means dedicated bandwidth for storage networking - separate from data networking
- [AWS doc on enhanced networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/enhanced-networking.html)

Enhanced Networking

- single root IO virtualization
- is how NIC is aware of virtualization - see slide for image
- higher IO and lower host CPU usage
- no charge
- more bandwidth
- higher packet per second - PPS
- consistent lower latency

  ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7ec73222-1738-4f1d-9811-9b2c9aaf2df7/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_12.07.34_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7ec73222-1738-4f1d-9811-9b2c9aaf2df7/Screen_Shot_2021-06-20_at_12.07.34_PM.png)

EBS Optimized Instances

- is an option set on per instance basis
- means there is a dedicated capacity for EBS
- most instances are supported and enabled by default
- older instances - some support but enabling is extra
