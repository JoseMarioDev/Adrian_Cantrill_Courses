## 🗒️  Notes

### Basics

Concepts

- Global storage platform
- regionally resilient/based
- stored in a specific region, data doesnt leave reason unless you specifiy
- public service, runs from public zone
- store large amts of data - movies, audio, photos, txt
- access via UI/CLI/API/HTTP

Objects

- think of as files you store in a bucket
- made up of
    - key
    - value
    - metadata
- size of object can be 0 bytes to 5TB

Buckets

- created in specific region
- bucket never leaves region unless you config
- blast region is the region it's in
- bucket names need to be globally unique
- can hold unlimited number of objects
- has flat structure
- the UI presents this as folders, but not the case. That's done for visually ease
- folders are referred to as prefixes in S3
- permissions are set on buckets

Exam Power Ups

- bucket names are globally unique
- 3-63 characters all lowercase no underscore, start w/lowercase, cant be ip formatted
- bucket limits - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard per account
- unlimited objects in bucket
- key/value data structure
- is object store
    - not file storage
    - not block storage
- is flat
- cant be mounted as drive
- great for large scale data storage, distribution, upload
- great for offloading

### 🔐  S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)

Concepts

- S3 is private by default
- only identity that has access is the account that created the bucket
- use bucket policies to grant permissions.
    - bucket policies are a form of resource policies, but attached to a bucket
    - only one policy per bucket, but can have multiple statements
- allow/deny same or different accounts
- can allow/deny anonymous principals

Visual Example

- the `principal` part of the policy statement identifies who the statement applies to
    - `principal` is stated in resource policies because it could apply to multiple identities

Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- older method of applying permissions to buckets
- can apply to objects and buckets
- not recommended
- inflexible, no conditions

Block Public Access

- apply to anonymous principals
- settings created to enhance security for public access

Exam Power Up

- when to use identity policies vs bucket polices
