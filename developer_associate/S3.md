- Global storage platform
- regionally resilient/based
- stored in a specific region, data doesnt leave reason unless you specifiy
- public service, runs from public zone
- store large amts of data - movies, audio, photos, txt
- access via UI/CLI/API/HTTP

Objects

- think of as files you store in a bucket
- made up of
  - key
  - value
  - metadata
- size of object can be 0 bytes to 5TB

Buckets

- created in specific region
- bucket never leaves region unless you config
- blast region is the region it's in
- bucket names need to be globally unique
- can hold unlimited number of objects
- has flat structure
- the UI presents this as folders, but not the case. That's done for visually ease
- folders are referred to as prefixes in S3
- permissions are set on buckets

- unlimited objects in bucket
- key/value data structure
- is object store
  - not file storage
  - not block storage
- is flat
- cant be mounted as drive
- great for large scale data storage, distribution, upload
- great for offloading
