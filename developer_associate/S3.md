## üóíÔ∏è  Notes

### Basics

Concepts

- Global storage platform
- regionally resilient/based
- stored in a specific region, data doesnt leave reason unless you specifiy
- public service, runs from public zone
- store large amts of data - movies, audio, photos, txt
- access via UI/CLI/API/HTTP

Objects

- think of as files you store in a bucket
- made up of
    - key
    - value
    - metadata
- size of object can be 0 bytes to 5TB

Buckets

- created in specific region
- bucket never leaves region unless you config
- blast region is the region it's in
- bucket names need to be globally unique
- can hold unlimited number of objects
- has flat structure
- the UI presents this as folders, but not the case. That's done for visually ease
- folders are referred to as prefixes in S3
- permissions are set on buckets

Exam Power Ups

- bucket names are globally unique
- 3-63 characters all lowercase no underscore, start w/lowercase, cant be ip formatted
- bucket limits - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard per account
- unlimited objects in bucket
- key/value data structure
- is object store
    - not file storage
    - not block storage
- is flat
- cant be mounted as drive
- great for large scale data storage, distribution, upload
- great for offloading

### üîê  S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)

Concepts

- S3 is private by default
- only identity that has access is the account that created the bucket
- use bucket policies to grant permissions.
    - bucket policies are a form of resource policies, but attached to a bucket
    - only one policy per bucket, but can have multiple statements
- allow/deny same or different accounts
- can allow/deny anonymous principals

Visual Example

- the `principal` part of the policy statement identifies who the statement applies to
    - `principal` is stated in resource policies because it could apply to multiple identities

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50284e9a-36c4-4bd4-877d-649cdb91aec0/Screen_Shot_2021-05-19_at_6.51.11_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50284e9a-36c4-4bd4-877d-649cdb91aec0/Screen_Shot_2021-05-19_at_6.51.11_PM.png)

Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- older method of applying permissions to buckets
- can apply to objects and buckets
- not recommended
- inflexible, no conditions

Block Public Access

- apply to anonymous principals
- settings created to enhance security for public access

Exam Power Up

- when to use identity policies vs bucket polices

### üîê  S3 Static Hosting

Concepts

- allows access to S3 via HTTP
- set Index and Error documents
- website endpoint is created
- custom domain via Route 53, but bucket name matters

Use Cases

- off loading
    - static media - images, media, large data
- Out-of-bound pages
    - error or status notification system
- there is a request charge for S3 bucket
    - might incur charges if website has heavy usage

---

### üîê  Object Versioning & MFA Delete

Concepts

- feature that can be enabled on an S3 bucket
- is disabled by default
    - once enabled, cannot switch back to disabled
    - can suspend, then re-enabled
- allows bucket to store multiple versions of objects
    - these objects can be referenced by their version ID to interact directly

        ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fa40a705-19a6-486c-8b8a-101c9dfa8699/Screen_Shot_2021-05-21_at_8.08.26_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fa40a705-19a6-486c-8b8a-101c9dfa8699/Screen_Shot_2021-05-21_at_8.08.26_AM.png)

- Objects aren't deleted
    - deleted markers are put in place to hide objects
- you can delete an object still

MFA Delete

- enabled in versioning configuration
- once enabled, MFA is required to change bucket versioning state
- MFA is required to delete versions

---

### üèéÔ∏è  S3 Performance Optimization

Concepts

- by default, `PUT` requests are uploaded as a single data stream
    - problem ‚Üí if stream fails, upload fails
        - requires full restart
- any upload up to 5gb data
- multipart uploads break uploads in multiple parts

Multipart Upload

- data is broken up
- min data size is 100mb for multipart
- 10,000 max parts
- last part can be smaller than 5mb
- transfer rate = speeds of all parts

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6c5f7384-e03a-4510-8a38-66b69bd5215d/Screen_Shot_2021-05-21_at_8.18.12_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6c5f7384-e03a-4510-8a38-66b69bd5215d/Screen_Shot_2021-05-21_at_8.18.12_AM.png)

S3 Transfer Acceleration

- uses AWS network of edge locations
- needs to be enabled, disabled by default
- restrictions:
    - bucket name cannot contain period
    - name needs to be DNS compatible

### üîê  Object Encryption

Concepts

- Buckets aren't encrypted, objects are
- encryption defined at object level
- encryption for data at rest
- server side encryption, data is encrypted once it hits S3

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4d24ebd9-8164-4f7b-ac41-3fc6d44dabd8/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.24.51_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4d24ebd9-8164-4f7b-ac41-3fc6d44dabd8/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.24.51_AM.png)

Client-Side Encryption

- object being uploaded are encrypted by client before they leave

SSE-C

- server side encryption with customer provided keys
- customer is responsible for keys
- S3 manages encryption

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1759e69f-5d94-4a1b-b4df-72a689a926a2/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.28.20_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1759e69f-5d94-4a1b-b4df-72a689a926a2/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.28.20_AM.png)

SSE-S3

- SSE w/Amazon S3 managed keys
- AWS handles encryption/decryption process
- users just provides object, AWS does rest
- default type of encryption
- may not be suitable if in a heavy regulatory env, or you need to manage keys, or role separation

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/871f0d65-d9b1-4c9d-9494-1af51f6b2807/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.31.40_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/871f0d65-d9b1-4c9d-9494-1af51f6b2807/Screen_Shot_2021-05-23_at_8.31.40_AM.png)

SSE-KMS

- SSE w/CMKs stores in AWS KMS
- KMS creates the CMK
- control of master keys and rotation
- allows for role separation

### üîê  S3 Object Storage Classes

Concepts

- diff tiers each with pros/cons/requirements/pricing

S3 Standard

- default
- objects stored across at least 3 AZs - replication
- cope w/multiple AZ failure
- 11 9s durability
- billed gb/month fee
- out requests fee per 1000/requests.  in is free
- no specific retrieval fee, no min duration, no min size
- miliseconds latency, can be made publicly available

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c96d678f-6433-45a1-883d-57b057e9bfaf/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.46.01_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c96d678f-6433-45a1-883d-57b057e9bfaf/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.46.01_PM.png)

S3 Standard Infrequent Access

- similar to S3 Standard, but has a retrieval fee
- cheaper vs standard
- minumum duration charge

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/620721d4-7201-4a09-baa0-68195fee3492/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.48.22_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/620721d4-7201-4a09-baa0-68195fee3492/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.48.22_PM.png)

S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

- cheaper than first two
- retrieval fee
- min 30 days duration
- data stored in only one AZ - no replication across multiple AZs

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dd3f9bb9-cc7d-4dde-864c-1319ba4de0ca/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.49.50_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dd3f9bb9-cc7d-4dde-864c-1319ba4de0ca/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.49.50_PM.png)

S3 Glacier

- three AZ replication architecture
- 11 9s durability
- cheap
- "cold" objects - not immediately available.  need to retrieve
- pay for retrieval process
- 90 days min duration
- retrieval types - expedited, standard, bulk

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6d83f998-5472-4157-8052-4a6435c67e34/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.52.56_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6d83f998-5472-4157-8052-4a6435c67e34/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.52.56_PM.png)

S3 Glacier Deep Archive

- 180 min duration
- restore jobs take longer

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/367b5a03-5b5e-43a8-8027-7b4c779475ed/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.54.35_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/367b5a03-5b5e-43a8-8027-7b4c779475ed/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.54.35_PM.png)

Intelligent Tiering

- storage class w/4 tiers
    - frequent
    - infrequent
    - archive
    - deep archive
- system moves objects between tiers for you

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/60881aaa-eb52-4e0d-aec8-58af52f34d87/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.58.08_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/60881aaa-eb52-4e0d-aec8-58af52f34d87/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_7.58.08_PM.png)

### üîê  S3 Lifecycle Configuration

Concepts

- create rules to automatically move objects between tiers
- optimize costs
- set of rules applied to bucket based on actions
- 2 types of actions - transition and expiration

Visually

- flows downward only
- objects must be in Standard for min 30 days before transition
- smaller objects can cost more because of size minimums on certain tiers

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bfdffd6d-7197-4931-8797-75fb8c777d27/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_8.07.28_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bfdffd6d-7197-4931-8797-75fb8c777d27/Screen_Shot_2021-05-24_at_8.07.28_PM.png)

---

### üîê  S3 Replication

Concepts

- feature allows objs to be replicated between src and dest buckets in the same or diff AWS accounts
- 3 types - Cross Region Replication and Same Region Replication
- configuration is setup on the src bucket
    - config IAM role
    - encrypted
- if configuring replication in diff AWS accounts, the dest bucket needs to trust the src bucket and role
- need to setup bucket policy on dest bucket

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38b9a7fc-626e-4505-a87a-faeffa0c0304/Screen_Shot_2021-05-25_at_2.15.16_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38b9a7fc-626e-4505-a87a-faeffa0c0304/Screen_Shot_2021-05-25_at_2.15.16_PM.png)

- this happens automatically if in the same account

Replication Options

- all objs or subset
- storage class default to maintain
- define ownership of obj in dest bucket
- replication time control - adds 15 minute SLA.  guaranteed delivery predictability

Considerations for exam

- not retroactive and versioning needs to be on
- one way replication process from source to dest
- obj can be unencrypted, SSE-S3, SSE-KMS(with extra config)
- src bucket owner needs permissions to objs
- no system events, Glacier, or Glacier Deep Archive
- No Deletes - they are not replicated

Use Cases

- SRR
    - log aggregation
    - sync PROD and TEST accounts
    - resilience if you have sovereignty requirements
- CRR
    - global resiliency
    - latency reduction

### üîê  S3 PreSigned URLs

Concepts

- feat of S3 that allows system to generate a URL w/access permissions encoded into it
- applies to a specific bucket and obj
- for a certain time period

Visually

- unauthenticated user wants to access bucket
    - possible solutions
        - give user an AWS identity
        - provide user w/AWS creds
        - make bucket public
    - all of these pose problems

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/eb3241b7-b738-4470-a3ec-22eb2973b2ac/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.09.11_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/eb3241b7-b738-4470-a3ec-22eb2973b2ac/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.09.11_PM.png)

- solution:  an IAMadmin users generates a presigned URL with appropriate config
- presigned URL is given to unauthenticated user

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0daf4c0c-8b2d-4f73-b4f3-c183b755be7a/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.12.06_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0daf4c0c-8b2d-4f73-b4f3-c183b755be7a/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.12.06_PM.png)

- example use case: video processing application.  an app where user uploads media to a bucket

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5ef45288-5a0d-49d2-b3f6-ce830260b888/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.17.17_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5ef45288-5a0d-49d2-b3f6-ce830260b888/Screen_Shot_2021-05-26_at_12.17.17_PM.png)

Exam Power Ups

- you can create a presigned URL for an obj you don't have access to
- when using the URL, the permissions match the identity which generated it
- don't generate presigned URL with a role.  URL stops working when temp creds expire

---

### üîê  S3 Select and Glacier Select

Concepts

- allows you to use SQL like statements to retrieve partial objects from S3 and Glacier
- S3 can store huge objects - up to 5TB
- retrieving a 5TB obj takes a lot of time, uses all 5TB
- the prefiltered part is selected by S3
- .csv, JSON, etc
- filter occurs before data is sent to application, saves on cost

Visually

---

### üîê  Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Concepts

- defines a way for web apps loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a diff domain
- use w/S3 to selectively allow cross-origin access to S3 resources
- CORS is defined on the different domain than the origin

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6747b0b5-62a0-4d3d-bf74-8ed53a9f40ac/Screen_Shot_2021-05-27_at_2.49.11_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6747b0b5-62a0-4d3d-bf74-8ed53a9f40ac/Screen_Shot_2021-05-27_at_2.49.11_PM.png)

- required CORS configuration in JSON

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/372d4828-cfc1-452c-9d78-cf451401b7cd/Screen_Shot_2021-05-27_at_2.50.47_PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/372d4828-cfc1-452c-9d78-cf451401b7cd/Screen_Shot_2021-05-27_at_2.50.47_PM.png)

- two types of requests you can make
    - simple
    - preflight - check from browser to origin if it's ok to send.  for more complicated requests

Headers Configuration

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - src website
- `Access-Control-Max-Age` - how long if preflight request can be cached
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` - what types of requests can be made. ex: `get, put`
- `Access-Control-Headers` - which headers can be used in the request

---

### üîê  S3 Events

Concepts

- feature that allows you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket
- need to add notification configuration  that identifies the events you want S3 to publish and the destinations you want S3 to send notifications
- store configuration the the notification subresource associated w/bucket
- notification generated when events occur in a bucket
- can be delivered to SNS, SQS, and Lambda functions
- ex: created when obj created, deletion, restore, replication

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/968d1075-b03d-436e-af46-23b43af5feb6/Screen_Shot_2021-05-29_at_11.23.09_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/968d1075-b03d-436e-af46-23b43af5feb6/Screen_Shot_2021-05-29_at_11.23.09_AM.png)

Visually

- S3 bucket, define notification config ex: create, delete, restore, replication
    - sent to [Lambda](https://www.notion.so/Lambda-4acf1e5f627b4638a8b2815b30c22e27)  SQS, SNS
    - add resource policy allowing S3 principal access
    - events themselves are JSON objs
- can also use EventBridge as alternative
    - supports more services and types of events

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6204f217-1d8a-43a9-bd1f-9642b5b4f079/Screen_Shot_2021-05-29_at_11.33.39_AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6204f217-1d8a-43a9-bd1f-9642b5b4f079/Screen_Shot_2021-05-29_at_11.33.39_AM.png)
