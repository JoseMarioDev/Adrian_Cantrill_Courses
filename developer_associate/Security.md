3 examples of policy interpretation

### Policy Interpretation Deep Dive - Example 1

Concepts

- step through IAM policy examples and learn how to interpret them, understand their effects
- policy evaluation ‚Üí [https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy1_holidaygifts.json](https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy1_holidaygifts.json)

Steps to understanding a policy document

1. identify how many statements make up policy document
   1. either single or list of statements - square brackets
   2. can be a list of objects
2. identify the effect of each statement
   1. what it actually does
   2. `Effect` is either `allow` or `deny`
   3. `Resource` identifies what is being affected
      1. wild card means all objs inside bucket
   4. example 1 has a `Condition` block

### Policy Interpretation Deep Dive - Example 2

Concepts

- learn how to restrict usage of regions via IAM policies and learn about `NotAction` conditions
- policy evaluated ‚Üí [https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy2_region.json](https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy2_region.json)
- example uses inverse logic by using not operations
- deny policies are usually accompanied by an allow policy
  - because by default, things are denied

### Policy Interpretation Deep Dive - Example 3

Concepts

- how to secure S3 based on home folders and IAM policy variables
- policy evaluated ‚Üí [https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy3_homefolders.json](https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate/blob/main/08_Security/PolicyEvaluation/policy3_homefolders.json)
- AWS documentation on variables and tags

[IAM policy elements: Variables and tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html)

- this policy performs a prefix condition check to interact inside home folder only
  - using`${aws:username}` variable

### AWS Permissions Evaluation

Concepts

- policy evaluation process AWS uses for single and multi-account access scenarios
- same process is used each and every time an identity attempts to access a resource

Considerations

1. Organization SCPs
2. Resource policies
3. IAM identity boundaries
4. Session policies - when using roles
5. identity policies

Flow to evaluate permissions

1. first checks to see if there is an explicit deny. if so, game over
2. are there any SCPs?
   1. do they allow the action? if not, implicit deny
3. is there a resource policy?
   1. if yes, all good
4. are there any permission boundaries?
5. are there any session policies?
6. identity policies?

Multiple Accounts Evaluation Logic

- require applicable allow from account A and Account B

### CloudHSM

Concepts

- required to achieve compliance with certain security standards such as FIPS 140-2 Level 3

[FIPS 140-2 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2)

- HSM - Hardware Security Module
- true "single tenant" HSM
- AWS provisioned, fully customer managed
- compliant - FIPS 140-2 Level 3
  - KMS is L2
- accessed with industry standard APIs
  - PKCS#11
  - JCE
  - Microsoft CryptoNG (CNG)
- KMS can use CloudHSM as a custom key store
  - integration w/KMS

Visually

- deployed in a separate VPC
- need to create a cluster for HA
- interact with customer VPC using ENI
- needs to have CloudHSM client on EC2 instances
- AWS has no access to secure area when key material is held

Use Cases

- no native integration between CloudHSM and AWS services
- can be used for off-loading SSL/TLS processing for web servers
- can be used to enable Transparent Data Encryption for Oracle Databases
- protect private keys for issuing Certificate Authority
